# AI Usage Report – Assignment 3

## 1. Tools Used
- **ChatGPT**  
  Used for:
  - Explaining how to integrate the GitHub API  
  - Helping structure sorting logic and state management  
  - Suggesting better error-handling patterns  
  - Improving clarity of documentation sections  

---

## 2. How AI Was Used

###  API Integration Support
AI helped me understand:
- Which GitHub API endpoint to use  
- How to make a `fetch()` request using `async/await`  
- How to handle different responses (success, 404, network error)  
- How to display the fetched data inside my page  

I rewrote and adapted the code to match my existing HTML/CSS.

---

### Complex Logic (Sorting )
The AI suggested approaches for:
- Sorting project cards A→Z and Z→A  
- Saving sorting state using `localStorage`  
- Reordering DOM elements efficiently  

I implemented the logic manually based on the explanation.

---

### Error Handling & User Feedback
AI provided ideas for:
- Loading messages  
- Friendly error text  
- Retry buttons  
- “No repositories found” states  

I customized the wording and wrote the final implementation myself.

## 3. Benefits of AI Assistance
- Faster understanding of the GitHub API  
- Clearer idea of how to structure asynchronous JavaScript  
- Improved sorting and filtering logic  
- Better UX ideas for feedback and loading states  


---

## 4. Challenges Faced
- Some AI-generated code was too advanced, so I simplified it  
- Needed to modify examples to fit my existing project  
- Had to test different API error scenarios manually  

---

## 5. Learning Outcomes
From this assignment, I learned:
- How to connect a webpage to an external API  
- How to work with async/await and promises  
- How to manage state (theme, filters, sorting, GitHub username)  
- How to build multi-step logic (filter → sort → render)  
- How to design better user feedback and error handling  
- How to debug API responses in DevTools

## 6. Responsible and Ethical AI Usage
I used AI only as a **helper** to understand concepts.  
I modified all suggestions, wrote custom code, and validated everything myself.  
No unmodified AI output was submitted.  
All code decisions were my own, and AI was used for learning, not replacing my work.
